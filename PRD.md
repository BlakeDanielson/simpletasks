Technical Specification: AI-Powered Streamlined Productivity Web App (MVP)
1. Overview
A desktop-first web app that captures ideas and tasks via natural language, presenting them in a single “smart view” optimized for quick daily action and long-term project tracking. AI assists by detecting missed/overdue items and nudges users daily with notifications and in-app prompts. Users manage manual collapsible task groups. The app integrates externally with calendar, docs, and email to execute certain actions on user confirmation. Modes (planning, deep work, light admin) adjust UI layout to match user context.

2. Core Features & User Flow
2.1. Capture
Input method: Text input box supporting natural language.

Supported input types:

Tasks (e.g., “Buy groceries,” “Finish project proposal”).

Notes and stream-of-consciousness dumps (to be parsed later).

Quick commands for reminders and simple task creation (e.g., “Remind me to call John next Tuesday”).

AI processing: Parse input to identify task metadata (due dates, groups, action types).

Messy notes handling: Allow free text input; AI extracts actionable tasks where possible; other text saved as notes.

2.2. Display
Single Smart View:

Combines tasks due today, upcoming deadlines, and long-term projects.

Tasks grouped manually by user, with collapsible/expandable groups.

Visual distinction between completed (strike-through) and pending tasks.

Kanban style and list views toggle-able (default is smart list).

Focused Views: User can toggle to focus on groups or task types if desired.

2.3. Task & Group Management
Manual grouping: User creates task groups, assigns tasks to groups.

Groups are collapsible: UI supports expanding/collapsing groups to reduce clutter.

Task completion: Checkboxes toggle completed state; completed tasks get strike-through styling.

No auto prioritization: Tasks ordered by due date and manual group order.

2.4. AI Role
Daily Nudges:

Once per day, AI generates summary of missed deadlines, overdue tasks, and upcoming deadlines.

Nudges delivered via desktop notifications (Slack-style) and in-app prompt if open.

Proactive suggestions: AI detects if tasks are missing deadlines or if user hasn’t engaged with tasks recently and prompts for action.

No auto scheduling or full plan generation for MVP.

2.5. External Actions
Supported external integrations (MVP priority order):

Google Calendar event creation

Document creation (e.g., Google Docs, Notion)

Email sending

Workflow:

AI detects relevant commands or tasks linked to external actions.

On user confirmation prompt, AI triggers action via API integrations.

User confirmation required for all external actions before execution.

2.6. Modes
Available modes: Planning, Deep Work, Light Admin

Mode switching changes: Only UI layout and visible features; task content remains constant.

Examples:

Planning mode shows all tasks + notes with expanded group views.

Deep Work mode focuses on today’s critical tasks, minimal distractions.

Light Admin mode surfaces smaller tasks and quick actions.

2.7. Notifications
Desktop notifications: Slack-style push notifications once daily, or for urgent reminders.

In-app notifications: If app is open, prompts appear inline or as a toast.

User dismissible.

2.8. Export
Formats supported: CSV, Markdown, JSON

Export scope: Tasks (completed & pending), groups, notes.

User-triggered manual export.

3. System Architecture
3.1. Frontend
Framework: React (or similar modern SPA framework)

UI: Responsive desktop-first layout, minimal but discoverable features.

State management: Redux, Zustand, or context API for task and UI state.

Notifications: Browser Notifications API + in-app toast component.

3.2. Backend
API server: Node.js with Express or Fastify, or serverless functions.

Database:

Primary data store for tasks, groups, notes, user profiles (PostgreSQL or MongoDB).

Indexed for fast retrieval by due date, group, completion status.

AI Integration:

Calls to external AI API (OpenAI GPT-4 or custom models) for parsing natural language inputs and generating nudges.

AI logic runs on backend to offload client.

3.3. External Integrations
OAuth2 authentication: For Google Calendar, Google Docs, Notion, Gmail, Slack.

API connectors: REST or GraphQL clients to interact with external services.

Action queue: Backend manages API calls with user confirmation checkpoint.

3.4. Notifications System
Push Notifications: Web Push API + service worker for desktop notifications.

In-app: Real-time UI updates via WebSocket or polling.

4. User Interface Details
4.1. Main Smart View Layout
Header: App name, mode switcher dropdown, quick add task input.

Sidebar (optional): Collapsible manual groups list with expand/collapse toggles.

Main pane:

Top section: Today’s tasks with due dates.

Below: Grouped long-term projects/tasks.

Toggle buttons to switch to Kanban view or focused group view.

4.2. Task Item
Checkbox to mark complete

Task title with inline due date if applicable

Expand/collapse for notes/details attached to task

Drag & drop in Kanban mode for reordering/group changes

4.3. AI Notification Area
Toast popups for nudges/reminders

In-app notification icon with count

Click opens a daily summary modal with actionable items

4.4. Modes UI
Mode-specific layout adjustments triggered by mode switcher:

Planning: show full groups, detailed notes

Deep Work: filtered today’s tasks only, minimal UI chrome

Light Admin: focus on small, quick tasks, reduced detail

5. AI/Natural Language Processing (NLP)
5.1. Input Parsing
Parse text input to extract:

Tasks (title, due dates, groups if mentioned)

Reminders (time/date triggers)

Notes

Use pretrained NLP model fine-tuned on task and reminder extraction.

5.2. Daily Nudges Logic
Query user tasks to detect:

Overdue/missed deadlines

Tasks without deadlines but created long ago and incomplete

Upcoming deadlines within next 3 days

Generate plain language summary with links to task for quick action.

5.3. Command Recognition (MVP limited)
Basic commands for reminder creation and external actions only.

6. Security & Privacy
User authentication (OAuth + email login)

Permissions and scopes for external API access carefully limited

Data encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest

User data export available anytime

Option to delete account and all data

7. Deployment & Hosting
Cloud-hosted backend (AWS/GCP/Azure or Vercel for frontend + serverless)

CDN for frontend assets

Scalable DB instance

Scheduled backend jobs for daily AI nudge generation and notification dispatch

8. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)
Voice input support

AI-generated task prioritization and planning

Automatic grouping suggestions

More modes and UI personalization

Mobile app or responsive mobile design

Time tracking and productivity analytics

Motivational nudges and summaries

Summary
This MVP specification focuses on minimal but effective core flows: fast capture via natural language, unified smart view with grouped tasks, AI daily nudges to reduce task loss, and seamless external integrations triggered by AI with user confirmation. Modes let users adjust UI to their workflow without complexity.
